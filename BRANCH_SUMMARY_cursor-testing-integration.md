# Branch Summary: cursor-testing-integration

**Created:** 2025-01-11  
**Branch:** `cursor-testing-integration`  
**Base:** `cursor-main`  
**Commit:** `8d20600`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All tests passing

## Overview

Implemented fast integration testing setup using Jest + React Native Testing Library for rapid development iterations. Tests run in < 1 second with no simulator required.

## What's Included

### Test Infrastructure

1. **jest.config.js** - Updated configuration
   - Added `setupFilesAfterEnv` for setup file
   - Configured `transformIgnorePatterns` for React Native modules
   - Added `moduleNameMapper` for image mocks
   - Configured `collectCoverageFrom` for coverage reporting

2. **jest.setup.js** - Mock setup for native modules
   - VideoPlayerView mock
   - CacheManager mock
   - FastImage mock with priority/cacheControl
   - react-native-gesture-handler mock
   - RecyclerListView mock
   - react-native-fs mock
   - Console warning suppression

3. **__mocks__/fileMock.js** - Image asset mock
   - Simple stub for image imports

### Integration Tests (18 tests, 4 suites)

1. **VideoCard Integration** (3 tests)
   - ✓ Renders without crashing
   - ✓ Accepts required props
   - ✓ Calls handleVisibilityChange on mount

2. **PlaybackManager Integration** (6 tests)
   - ✓ Emits play event when video becomes active
   - ✓ Emits pause event when video leaves active state
   - ✓ Handles video transitioning to different states
   - ✓ Handles visibility change from notActive to prefetch
   - ✓ Handles visibility change from prefetch to prepareToBeActive
   - ✓ Handles released state without errors

3. **CacheManager Integration** (5 tests)
   - ✓ Returns cache status for video URL
   - ✓ Handles cache setup without errors
   - ✓ Gets total cache size
   - ✓ Clears cache successfully
   - ✓ Calls getCacheStatus with correct URL

4. **AppConfig Integration** (4 tests)
   - ✓ Is importable without errors
   - ✓ Exports AppConfig class
   - ✓ Has config object available
   - ✓ Has expected config sections

### Test Scripts

Added to `package.json`:
- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Watch mode for rapid iterations
- `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage report
- `npm run test:integration` - Run only integration tests

### Documentation

**TESTING_INTEGRATION.md** - Comprehensive testing guide
- Running tests
- Writing tests
- Mocking native modules
- Test coverage goals
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices

## Test Results

```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       18 passed, 18 total
Time:        0.87 s
```

## Key Features

### Fast Feedback Loop
- Tests run in < 1 second
- No simulator/emulator startup time
- Runs in Node environment
- Perfect for rapid iterations

### Comprehensive Mocking
All native modules properly mocked:
- VideoPlayerView (custom native player)
- CacheManager (KTVHTTPCache wrapper)
- FastImage (image caching)
- RecyclerListView (list virtualization)
- react-native-fs (file system)
- react-native-gesture-handler (gestures)

### Easy to Extend
Clear patterns for:
- Adding new test files
- Mocking additional modules
- Testing new components
- Verifying behavior

## What This Enables

### For Development
- Catch regressions immediately
- Test behavior without running the app
- Quick validation during refactoring
- Safe experimentation

### For CI/CD (Future)
- Fast pre-merge validation
- Automated regression testing
- Coverage tracking over time
- Build confidence

## Dependencies Added

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@testing-library/react-native": "^12.4.2"
}
```

Note: `@testing-library/jest-native` was deprecated - using built-in matchers from react-native-testing-library instead.

## Testing Strategy

### What We Test
- Component rendering (doesn't crash)
- Props acceptance
- Event emission (play/pause)
- State transitions
- API contracts (CacheManager, AppConfig)

### What We Don't Test (Yet)
- Native iOS code (XCTest needed)
- Visual appearance (Detox E2E needed)
- Performance metrics
- Network layer integration

These will be added in future iterations as needed.

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `jest.setup.js`
- `__mocks__/fileMock.js`
- `__tests__/integration/VideoCard.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/integration/PlaybackManager.test.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/CacheManager.test.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/AppConfig.test.ts`
- `TESTING_INTEGRATION.md`

**Modified:**
- `jest.config.js`
- `package.json` (scripts and devDependencies)
- `package-lock.json`

**Total:** 10 files changed, 651 insertions

## Merge Recommendations

Before merging to cursor-main:
- ✅ All tests passing (18/18)
- ✅ TypeScript compiles
- ✅ No new linting errors
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⚠️ Consider running on CI (future)
- ⚠️ Consider coverage targets (future)

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Add more test cases**
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test edge cases
   - Test interaction patterns

2. **Add E2E tests (Detox)**
   - Visual testing
   - User flow testing
   - Cross-platform testing

3. **Add native tests (XCTest)**
   - VideoPlayerView tests
   - VideoPlayerPool tests
   - CacheManager tests

4. **CI Integration**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Pre-merge test gates
   - Coverage reporting

5. **Coverage targets**
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds
   - Track coverage over time
   - Fail builds on coverage drops

## Usage

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:watch

# Only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Add New Tests
1. Create test file in `__tests__/integration/`
2. Import component/module to test
3. Write describe/it blocks
4. Use mocked modules from jest.setup.js
5. Run `npm run test:watch` to verify

### Debug Tests
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/integration/VideoCard.test.tsx

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run with debug logs
DEBUG=* npm test
```

## Notes

- Tests are isolated (mocked native modules)
- Tests run fast (< 1 second for all 18)
- Tests catch regressions in JS/TS layer
- Native layer needs separate testing (XCTest)
- Visual/UX needs E2E testing (Detox)
